# Phonax

Library to train jax models with phonon data.


## Quick Start

The following steps will guid you through the installation for the phonax library and the tests for tutorial notebooks.

1. In a conda env with JAX / CUDA available clone and download this phonax repository.

2. Download the pre-trained model weights and the example datasets.
    ```bash
    bash xxxx download_script
    ```

3. In the downloaded directory run:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
4. Install the additional libraries from github repositories:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements_extra.txt
    ```
